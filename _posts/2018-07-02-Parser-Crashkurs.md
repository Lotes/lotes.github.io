title: Parser Crashkurs
---
I have prepared and hold a presentation about the simplicity of writing a parser at my company.

7 employees were interested in it. 5 could join the meeting.

The presentation is in German language and can be watched [here](http://blog.lotes-lab.de/parser-crashkurs/).

I hope you can enjoy it! :D
