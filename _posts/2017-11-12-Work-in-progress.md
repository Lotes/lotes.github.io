Howdy strangers... my activity on Github is practically shrinked down to zero percent.
But don't worry! I currently working on several private projects on Bitbucket :-).
Have a little look on the project descriptions below ;-)...

## Project CQL

It is about a highly configurable language, filter and search box. The developer is supported by following features:

* configuration of type system, variables, functions
* auto-completion and syntax highlighting
* a WPF control with a simple and an advanced mode

## Project ReportMaker

A template engine for generating Excel files using a PHP-like syntax.
